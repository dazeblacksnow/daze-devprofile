            <h3 class="section-title">Education</h3>
            <p>Despite growing up with a diverese educational background in both arts and business, I once had an opportunity to experience software development while doing a user interface design job at a small development start-up during my university study. It has sparked a deep interest and curiosity in me that eventually pushed me to break away from my traditional education and pursue web development as a career through online education, projects and self-study. It was daunting but I was determined to make it work and here I am ready to call myself a full stack web developer.</p>
